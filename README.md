This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
```
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
```
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
First, you need to create a Whitelist-Dapp folder where the Hardhat project and your Next.js app will later go. Open up a terminal and execute these commands
```
mkdir Whitelist-Dapp
cd Whitelist-Dapp
```
Then, in Whitelist-Dapp folder, we will set up a Hardhat project
```
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:
```
npx hardhat
```
Make sure you select Create a Javascript Project and then follow the steps in the terminal to complete your Hardhat setup. Once your project is set up, start by creating a new file inside the contracts directory called Whitelist.sol. To see the smart contract code go to Whitelist.sol

We will deploy the contract to the goerli network. Create a new file, or replace the default file named deploy.js under the scripts folder. Now we will write code to deploy the contract in deploy.js file.

Now create a .env file in the hardhat-tutorial folder and add the following lines. Follow the instructions below.

To get your private key, you need to export it from Metamask. Open Metamask, click on the three dots, click on Account Details and then Export Private Key. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING A TEST ACCOUNT THAT DOES NOT HAVE MAINNET FUNDS FOR THIS. Add this Private Key below in your .env file for PRIVATE_KEY variable.

Now we will install dotenv package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing at hardhat-tutorial directory and execute this command.
```
npm install dotenv
```
Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing at hardhat-tutorial directory and execute this command
```
npx hardhat compile
```
To deploy, open up a terminal pointing at hardhat-tutorial directory and execute this command
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```
First, You will need to create a new next app. To create this next-app, in the terminal point to Whitelist-Dapp folder and type
```
npx create-next-app@latest
```
Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal
```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```
Open up a terminal pointing atmy-app directory and execute this command
```
npm install web3modal
```
In the same terminal also install ethers.js
```
npm install ethers
```
In your my-app/public folder, download this image and rename it to crypto-devs.svg Now go to your styles folder and replace all the contents of Home.modules.css file with the following code, this would add some styling to your dapp

Open your index.js file under the pages folder and paste the following code, explanation of the code can be found in the comments.

Now in your terminal which is pointing to my-app folder, execute
```
npm run dev
```
